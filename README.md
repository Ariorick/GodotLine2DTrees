# 2D Trees Generator for Godot 3.5

To use in your game just download the project and copy "tree" folder. Then add Random.gd to autoloads
Use ProceduralTree.tscn and customize it to your needs. 

You can also run the Main.tscn scene to generate trees with your parametres and save the ones you like. Resulting .tres files you can then put into ProceduralTree instances as "tree" parameter
Only branch positions are saved to resource file, all the colors, width parametres and other stuff can be set up later
